# Beatrun Animations

Extracted and reworked animations from Beatrun's source code.

## Blender Project File

Because Blender file is too big for Github, you can download it from Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DS_BUlo8XvivBzm3JYZqmdJeb0E10iCk/view?usp=sharing).

## How to edit

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to know how to use Blender and it's animation thing!\
> You also need to install [Blender Source Tools](http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/)!

* You can open `br_breen.blend` in Blender, it's already setup for you.
* When you done editing your animation, export it in SMD format in the `climbanim_anims` folder.
* And when you are ready, you can compile `climbanim.qc` into MDL file (I suggest using [Crowbar](https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar/releases/latest))
* Copy `models` folder from `compiled 0.XX` to `beatrun\gamemodes\beatrun\content\models` and select Replace.

### Recommended Crowbar settings
