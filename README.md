# Beatrun Animations
Extracted animations for Beatrun's sources.

## Blender Project File
Because Blender file is too big for Github, you can download it from my Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FaBClEI0EC0tWlfQAFhVmvZNCt7iFRRY/view?usp=sharing)

## How to edit
> You need to know how to use Blender and it's animation thing!\
> You also need to install Blender Source Tools from [here](http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/)!

* You can open `br_breen.blend` in Blender, it's already setup for you.
* When you done editing your animation, export it in SMD format in the `climbanim_anims` folder.
* And when you are ready, you can compile `climbanim.qc` into MDL file (I suggest using [Crowbar](https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar/releases/download/v0.74/Crowbar_2023-02-16_0.74.7z) ([Source](https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar)))
* Copy `models` folder from `compiled 0.XX` to `beatrun\gamemodes\beatrun\content\models` and select Replace.

### Recommended Crowbar settings
