# Beatrun Animations
Extracted animations for Beatrun's sources.

#### **Plese don't push your `br_breen.blend` file!**

## How to edit
> You need to know how to use Blender and it's animation thing!
> You also need to install Blender Source Tools from [here](http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/)!

* You can open `br_breen.blend` in Blender, it's already setup for you.
* When you done editing your animation, export it in SMD format in the `climbanim_anims` folder.
* And when you are ready, you can compile `climbanim.qc` into MDL file (I suggest using [Crowbar](https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar/releases/download/v0.74/Crowbar_2023-02-16_0.74.7z) ([Source](https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar)))
* Copy `models` folder from `compiled 0.XX` to `beatrun\gamemodes\beatrun\content\models` and select Replace.
