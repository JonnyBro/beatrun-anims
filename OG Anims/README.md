# Original Beatrun's animations
1. Copy `SafetyRoll.lua` to `beatrun\gamemodes\beatrun\gamemode\sh` and select Replace.
2. Copy **everything** from `Animations` folder to `beatrun\gamemodes\beatrun\content\models` and select Replace.

I will not support them, if you found a bug in those anims I will not fix them!
I will update Lua file in here if I update it in the main repo.
