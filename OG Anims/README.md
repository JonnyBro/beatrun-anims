# Original Beatrun's animations
Here you can find original Beatrun's animations with several fixes to major bugs. Also they are merged version of `climbanim` and `mirroranim` files to be compatible with my fork.

## Installation
1. Copy **everything** from `Animations` folder to `beatrun\gamemodes\beatrun\content\models` and select Replace.

I will not support them anymore, if you found a bug in those anims I will not fix them!
